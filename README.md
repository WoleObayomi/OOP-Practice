Inventory Manager
===================
Will allow user to store items in an inventory. Program will use the 'has-many' relationship, that is, and inventory has many items but an item maps to just one inventory.
This will reflect in the structure and composition of the classes

Quasi unique IDs will be generated for each item using the time the Item class was instantiated (in milliseconds)
